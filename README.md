# make-me-a-profile

This is a CLI app that allows the user to create a team profile based on answers to questions that are presented to them.  Quesions are done via Inquirer. 

The app also tests for new object creation via Jest.

Once a user completes the questionnaire, a index file will be created that displays a webpage based on their answers.
